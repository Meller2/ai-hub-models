# [Qwen3-1.7B: Multilingual 1.7B parameter language model excelling in reasoning and code generation](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen3_1_7b)

Qwen3 is a multilingual large language model series from Alibaba Cloud, excelling in language understanding, generation, coding, and mathematics.

This is based on the implementation of Qwen3-1.7B found [here](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B).
This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance across various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen3_1_7b).

Qualcomm AI Hub Models uses [Qualcomm AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com) to compile, profile, and evaluate this model. [Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.

## Quick Start

Use our lightweight command-line interface to inspect and download Qwen3-1.7B:

```bash
pip install qai_hub_models_cli # (the CLI is also available with the qai-hub-models package)

# Inspect the model and list the available download options
qai-hub-models info Qwen3-1.7B

# Print performance and accuracy metrics
qai-hub-models perf Qwen3-1.7B
qai-hub-models numerics Qwen3-1.7B

# Download a ready-to-deploy asset
qai-hub-models fetch Qwen3-1.7B --runtime qnn_context_binary --precision q4_0
```
See the [CLI README](../../../../cli/README.md)
for the full list of commands and filters.
