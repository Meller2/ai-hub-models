# [Granite-4.0-Micro: Compact language model from IBM optimized for enterprise tasks](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/granite_4_0_micro)

Granite 4.0 is a family of open language models from IBM designed for enterprise AI workloads including code generation, summarization, and retrieval-augmented generation.

This is based on the implementation of Granite-4.0-Micro found [here](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-4.0-h-micro).
This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance across various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/granite_4_0_micro).

Qualcomm AI Hub Models uses [Qualcomm AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com) to compile, profile, and evaluate this model. [Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.

## Quick Start

Use our lightweight command-line interface to inspect and download Granite-4.0-Micro:

```bash
pip install qai_hub_models_cli # (the CLI is also available with the qai-hub-models package)

# Inspect the model and list the available download options
qai-hub-models info Granite-4.0-Micro

# Print performance and accuracy metrics
qai-hub-models perf Granite-4.0-Micro
qai-hub-models numerics Granite-4.0-Micro

# Download a ready-to-deploy asset
qai-hub-models fetch Granite-4.0-Micro --runtime qnn_context_binary --precision q4_0
```
See the [CLI README](../../../../cli/README.md)
for the full list of commands and filters.
