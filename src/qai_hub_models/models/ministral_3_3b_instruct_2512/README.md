# [Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512: Efficient 3B parameter instruction-tuned model from Mistral AI](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/ministral_3_3b_instruct_2512)

Ministral is a compact language model from Mistral AI designed for on-device deployment, offering strong instruction-following capabilities with low latency.

This is based on the implementation of Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512 found [here](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512).
This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance across various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/ministral_3_3b_instruct_2512).

Qualcomm AI Hub Models uses [Qualcomm AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com) to compile, profile, and evaluate this model. [Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.
