# [Gemma-4-E4B-it: Multimodal model from Google DeepMind handling text and image input](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/gemma_4_e4b_it)

Gemma is a family of open models built by Google DeepMind. Gemma 4 models are multimodal, handling text and image input (with audio supported on small models) and generating text output. This release includes open-weights models in both pre-trained and instruction-tuned variants. Gemma 4 features a context window of up to 256K tokens and maintains multilingual support in over 140 languages.

This is based on the implementation of Gemma-4-E4B-it found [here](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-4-E4B-it).
This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance across various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/gemma_4_e4b_it).

Qualcomm AI Hub Models uses [Qualcomm AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com) to compile, profile, and evaluate this model. [Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.

## Quick Start

Use our lightweight command-line interface to inspect and download Gemma-4-E4B-it:

```bash
pip install qai_hub_models_cli # (the CLI is also available with the qai-hub-models package)

# Inspect the model and list the available download options
qai-hub-models info Gemma-4-E4B-it

# Print performance and accuracy metrics
qai-hub-models perf Gemma-4-E4B-it
qai-hub-models numerics Gemma-4-E4B-it

# Download a ready-to-deploy asset
qai-hub-models fetch Gemma-4-E4B-it --runtime geniex_llamacpp --precision q4_0
```
See the [CLI README](../../../../cli/README.md)
